# Music Tracker List
### What Is A Tracker?
a tracker is a type of music production software, which was popular from 1988 -> the early 2000s. they look like spreadsheets, and were often on retro computers. \
the first tracker, (The Ultimate Soundtracker) was leaked online shortly after it's release, causing demoscene groups to make their own hacks. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roBkg-iPrbw) has lots of information, and fun facts.
### Information on this list.
- Most of the entries are from [pouet.net](https://pouet.net), a demoscene website containing hoards of old trackers, tools, and demos.
- All information was found on the website the tracker was on.
- OSX is labelled as Mac
- The Thoughts collum is an opinion, a comment from the site, or personal observations. take it with a grain of salt.
- This list is in no order whatsoever. Use CTRL+F to find stuff.
- This list is not complete. it is purely my findings.
